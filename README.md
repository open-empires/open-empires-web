## Open Empires

I'm trying something ambitious: vibe-coding an Age Of Empires style RTS that lives in the web browser, rendered on canvas.

Long-term the backend will be written in spacetime DB. The goal is to have live matchmaking for 100 simultaneous players in a FFA and have clean open APIs for designing scenarios, mods, etc, and maybe support 100 such lobbies at a time. There'll be a subscription fee.
